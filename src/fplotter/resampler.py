    """
    Resamples univariate (2D) or bivariate (3D) sample data to a rectangular
    grid.

    This is a factory function that dispatches to the appropriate resampling
    helper based on the dimension of the input ``sample``.

    For univariate (2D) data, interpolation is not needed since sorting the 
    samples by their x-coordinates implicitly defines a rectangular grid in 1D. 
    However, for bivariate (3D) data, interpolation is necessary since sorting x 
    and y coordinates separately is insufficient - values must be interpolated 
    at all combinations of x,y coordinates to create a proper rectangular grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : Sample
        The input sample object to be resampled.
    method : {"linear", "cubic", "nearest"}, optional (default: "linear")
        The interpolation method to use for resampling. This parameter is only
        used for bivariate (3D) data:
        - linear: Uses linear interpolation between points
        - cubic: Uses Bezier polynomial interpolation
        - nearest: Interpolates using values from nearest points

    Returns
    -------
    Sample
        A new Sample object containing the resampled data.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the dimension of the input ``sample`` is not 2 or 3.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not modify the input ``sample``, it only returns a new
    sample object.

    Resamples univariate (2D) data to a rectangular grid.

    For univariate (2D) data, sorting points by their x-coordinates
    automatically creates a rectangular grid. Points that are too close together
    are removed since they provide little visual benefit in plotting. The 
    proximity threshold is determined by multiplying eps with the total x-axis 
    range.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray of shape (n_samples, 2)
        A ndarray representing the (x, y) data points.
    eps : float
        A small float value used to determine unique x and y coordinates.

    """
    Resamples bivariate (3D) data to a rectangular grid.

    The function internally uses ``scipy.interpolate.griddata()`` for
    interpolation. Available interpolation methods are:
    - nearest : Interpolates using values from nearest points
    - linear : First performs Delaunay triangulation using Qhull on x, y
        coordinates, then applies barycentric interpolation within each triangle
    - cubic : First performs Delaunay triangulation using Qhull on x, y
        coordinates, then uses Clough-Tocher scheme which fits a piecewise cubic
        Bezier polynomial on each triangle

    For more details on the Clough-Tocher scheme, see:

        Computer Aided Geometric Design 3.2 (1986): 83-127.

    Sampling points that are too close together on the x and y axes will be
    removed since they provide little benefit for plotting. The proximity
    threshold is determined by multiplying eps with the axis range.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray of shape (n_samples, 3)
        A ndarray representing the (x, y, z) data points.
    method : {"linear", "cubic", "nearest"}
        The interpolation method passed to ``scipy.interpolate.griddata``.
    eps : float
        A small float value used to determine unique x and y coordinates.
